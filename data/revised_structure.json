The cemetery was visited in 1979 and 1980 by the archeologist David Stronach. He found over 600 standing stones which are spread out in several locations. About half of them are on the ridge which he calls \"High Plateau\" South and south-east of that are small groups of stones on several other ridges and hillocks. At some distance, there is another group of perhaps 150 stones distributed over a wide area on the mountain's south side.",

When the king fathered an heir, he was compared to Min. \nHe was also a lunar god, invoked in this aspect with the epithet Protector of the Moon.

He was represented in a caricature of the human form, grotesquely misshapen, with an enormous phallus. The ass was sacrificed in his honor, probably because the ass symbolized lecherousness and was associated with the god's sexual potency.

The Athenians often conflated Priapus with Hermes, the god of boundaries, and depicted a hybrid deity with a winged helmet, sandals, and huge erection.  \nOutside his \"home\" region in Asia Minor, Priapus was regarded as something of a joke by urban dwellers. However, he played a more important role in the countryside, where he was seen as a guardian deity. He was regarded as the patron god of sailors and fishermen and others in need of good luck, and his presence was believed to avert the evil eye. Priapus does not appear to have had an organized cult and was mostly worshiped in gardens or homes, though there are attestations of temples dedicated to the god. ",

The phallic amulet symbolizes protection and fertility, a common Roman belief, and is used humorously by the characters. The phallic lamp adds to the comedic tone through its shape and the associated superstitions.

There are several examples of both anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic phallic representations displayed on land boundaries or thresholds, like in the case of the House of the Vettii, where the fresco portraying the god is placed right at the entrance of the building.  \nHowever, from the very beginning of the cult of Priapus, the deity is also associated with fertility: in this regard, the god is a patron of agriculture, but also a sort of lucky charm for young males approaching adulthood.",

In some way, this representation is connected to the one usually typical of satyrs, minor deities which, like Dionysus and Priapus, were related to the cult of fertility. Like Priapus, satyrs often tried to seduce nymphs and mortal women alike, with little success. Despite the similarities, the monstruosity and deformity of the satyrs were often immediately reflected in their faces and, at least at the earliest stages, they were represented with animalistic attributes, while Priapus' grotesque appearance is mostly related to his excessive phallus, explained by the myth as a punishment from Hera, due to her gealousy towards Aphrodite, either for her adulterous relationship with Zeus or for her success in the eyes of Paris.",

As Priapus, Mercury, who was mainly associated with trade and economic prosperity, was also worshipped as a patron of boundaries in Greek and Roman mythology. The combination of these meanings explains the meaning associated to Mercury in the tintinnabulum, which was usually hung to thresholds as an amulet for both protection and prosperity, conveyed by the phallus and the bag of gold.

It has a total of 50,693 m2 (545,650 sq ft), of which 30,000 m2 (320,000 sq ft) are offices, 3,210 m2 (34,600 sq ft) technical facilities, 8,132 m2 (87,530 sq ft) services, including an auditorium, and 9,132 m2 (98,300 sq ft) parking space. It cost &euro;130 million to build.\nIt opened in June 2005 and was officially opened by King Juan Carlos I on 16 September 2005. It is one in a collection of high-tech architecture examples in Barcelona.\nThe building was owned by the multinational group Agbar, which has its corporate headquarters in the building and which takes up most of the floors, leasing the remainder. The Agbar Tower was acquired in March 2010 for 165 million euros, after reaching an agreement with its former owner, the investment group Azurelau. Azurelau had previously bought the property in mid-2007. The purchase price was not disclosed.\nBy 2017 it was purchased by Merlin Properties real estate group and it was renamed as Torre Glòries after the name of the adjacent square.\n",
