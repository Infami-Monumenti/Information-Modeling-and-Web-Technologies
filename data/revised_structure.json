The cemetery was visited in 1979 and 1980 by the archeologist David Stronach. He found over 600 standing stones which are spread out in several locations. About half of them are on the ridge which he calls \"High Plateau\" South and south-east of that are small groups of stones on several other ridges and hillocks. At some distance, there is another group of perhaps 150 stones distributed over a wide area on the mountain's south side.",

However, he played a more important role in the countryside, where he was seen as a guardian deity. He was regarded as the patron god of sailors and fishermen and others in need of good luck, and his presence was believed to avert the evil eye. Priapus does not appear to have had an organized cult and was mostly worshiped in gardens or homes, though there are attestations of temples dedicated to the god. ",

Like Priapus, satyrs often tried to seduce nymphs and mortal women alike, with little success. Despite the similarities, the monstruosity and deformity of the satyrs were often immediately reflected in their faces and, at least at the earliest stages, they were represented with animalistic attributes, while Priapus' grotesque appearance is mostly related to his excessive phallus, explained by the myth as a punishment from Hera, due to her gealousy towards Aphrodite, either for her adulterous relationship with Zeus or for her success in the eyes of Paris.",

The tintinnabulum was a wind chime with several little bells connected to one main structure, and, in most cases, was represented as a fascinum - e.g. a phallus - sometimes winged or legged. This is, however, an anthropomorphic example of tintinnabulum, which conflates the gods Priapus, with the usual ithyphallic depiction, and Mercury, who was believed to be the son or father of the deity in some variants of the myth.",
                "text 2": "The merging of Hermes - which is the Greek equivalent of Mercury - and Priapus was already popular between Athenians and, evidently, outlived up to Roman times. In this particular example, the presence of Mercury is testified by the winged helmet, which was a typical attribute of the god. As Priapus, Mercury, who was mainly associated with trade and economic prosperity, was also worshipped as a patron of boundaries in Greek and Roman mythology. The combination of these meanings explains the meaning associated to Mercury in the tintinnabulum, which was usually hung to thresholds as an amulet for both protection and prosperity, conveyed by the phallus and the bag of gold.

While the paternity of Priapus is uncertain, shifting from Dionysus, to Zeus, to Mercury, all the variants of the myth present Aphrodite/Venus as the mother of Priapus. The unfortunate aspect of the god is a punishment coming from Hera, in one version for her jealousy towards Aphrodite's victory in the contest between Hera herself, Aphrodite and Athena, in another for the relation between Zeus and the goddess of love. As explained by the director of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli, which currently holds the work in the Secret Cabinet collection, the sculpture has a strong erotic tension, stressed by the action of untying the laces of the sandal and conveyed by the presence of figures related to love and erotism as Venus herself, Priapus and Eros.

He also painted several large religious pictures that adorned Parisian churches: in 1812, he donated a Death of Saint Monica and a Christ on the Cross to thechurch of Saint-Eustache. In 1819, he presented a Saint Pierre guérissant le boiteux (Saint Peter Healing the Limping Man) for thechurch of Saint-Séverin (now in thechurch of Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin), and in 1820 was commissioned to paint a Délivrance de saint Pierre (Deliverance of Saint Peter) for thechurch of Saint-Pierre in Bordeaux.
